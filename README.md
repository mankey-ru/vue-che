# vue-che
Vue.js directive-based validation plugin.
Supports context-specific (i.e. passengers list) validation.
# [Basic demo](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mankey-ru/vue-che/blob/master/demo/index.html)

# Why not model-based?
Vueify is great enough, it just didnt exist when I needed a vue validator with context support.
Since now it exists, directive-based validation has only one advantage in my humble opinion: its better when you have to create many forms without editing vue instance.
